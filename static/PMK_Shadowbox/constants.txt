	# cat=pmkshadowbox/enable/e6; type=boolean; label= Enable "continuous" galleries?: Set this true to enable "continuous" galleries. By default, the galleries will not let a user go before the first image or after the last. Enabling this feature will let the user go directly to the first image in a gallery from the last one by selecting "Next". Defaults to false.
	continuous = 0

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/enable/e7; type=boolean; label= Display gallery counter?: Set this false to hide the gallery counter. Counters are never displayed on elements that are not part of a gallery. Defaults to true.
	displayCounter = 1

	initialHeight = 160

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/dims/d3; type=int+; label= Counter limit: Limits the number of counter links that will be displayed in a "skip" style counter. If the actual number of gallery elements is greater than this value, the counter will be restrained to the elements immediately preceding and following the current element. Defaults to 10.
	counterLimit = 10

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/dims/d4; type=int+; label= Viewport padding: The amount of padding (in pixels) to maintain around the edge of the browser window. Defaults to 20.

	# Other options
	
	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o0; type=string; label= Initial Options for ImageMap Links: The shadowbox must be enabled in a different way for image maps, because the rel attribute is forbidden for area tags. We handle that by adding an initial shadowbox setup call for image maps. If you don't add some options here, then the defaults are used. You can change the options for each area tag by applying the shadowbox function call (Shadowbox.setup(document.getElementsByTagName('area'), {})) with your new options inside the curly braces before each area tag. Example: "player:'iframe',width:805,height:500"
	imageMapOptions = 

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o1; type=options[None=0, Dojo Toolkit=1, Ext=2, MooTools=3, Prototype=4, YUI=5, jQuery=6]; label= JS Adapter: Although Shadowbox can be used in standalone mode, it's just as easy to use Shadowbox with your JavaScript library of choice for a given project. This is accomplished using adapters. An adapter is a small file that tells Shadowbox which methods to call on the underlying framework to achieve some common purpose such as querying the DOM or handling events.
	adapter = 0

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o2; type=short; label= Resizing Duration: The duration (in seconds) of the resizing animations. Defaults to 0.55.
	resizeDuration = 0.55

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o3; type=short; label= Fade Duration: The duration (in seconds) of the fade animations. Defaults to 0.35.
	fadeDuration = 0.35

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o4; type=short; label= Slideshow delay: A delay (in seconds) to use for slideshows. If set to anything other than 0, this value determines an interval at which Shadowbox will automatically proceed to the next piece in the gallery. Defaults to 0.
	slideshowDelay = 0

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o5; type=short; label= Opacity level: The opacity to use for the modal overlay. Defaults to 0.8.
	overlayOpacity = 0.8

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o6; type=options[wh,hw,sync]; label= Animation sequence: The animation sequence to use when resizing Shadowbox. May be either "wh" (width first, then height), "hw" (height first, then width), or "sync" (both simultaneously). Defaults to "wh".
	animSequence = wh

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o7; type=options[default,skip]; label= Gallery counter mode: The mode to use for the gallery counter. May be either "default" or "skip". The default counter is a simple "1 of 5" message. The skip counter displays a separate link to each piece in the gallery, enabling quick navigation in large galleries. Defaults to "default".
	counterType = default

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o8; type=options[none,resize,drag]; label= Oversize handling: The mode to use for handling content that is too large for the viewport. May be one of "none", "resize", or "drag" (for images). The "none" setting will not alter the image dimensions, though clipping may occur. Setting this to "resize" enables on-the-fly resizing of large content. In this mode, the height and width of large, resizable content will be adjusted so that it may still be viewed in its entirety while maintaining its original aspect ratio. The "drag" mode will display an oversized image at its original resolution, but will allow the user to drag it within the view to see portions that may be clipped. See the demo for a demonstration of all three modes of operation. Defaults to "resize".
	handleOversize = resize

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//o9; type=options[link,remove]; label= Unsupported media handling: The mode to use for handling unsupported media. May be either "link" or "remove". Media are unsupported when the browser plugin required to display the media properly is not installed. The link option will display a user-friendly error message with a link to a page where the needed plugin can be downloaded. The remove option will simply remove any unsupported gallery elements from the gallery before displaying it. With this option, if the element is not part of a gallery, the link will simply be followed. Defaults to "link".
	handleUnsupported = link

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//oa; type=string; label= Exceptions function: A function to use for handling exceptions. This function will be passed the error message (string) as its only argument. If this value is left null, exceptions will not be caught. Defaults to null.
	handleException = null

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//ob; type=string; label= onOpen function: A hook function that will be fired when Shadowbox opens. The single argument of this function will be the current gallery element.  Defaults to null.
	onOpen = null

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//oc; type=string; label= onFinish function: A hook function that will fire when Shadowbox finishes loading the current gallery piece (after all animations are complete). The single argument of this function will be the current gallery element.  Defaults to null.
	onFinish = null

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//od; type=string; label= onChange function: A hook function that will be fired when Shadowbox changes from one gallery element to another. The single argument of this function will be the gallery element that is about to be displayed.  Defaults to null.
	onChange = null

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//oe; type=string; label= onClose function: A hook function that will be fired when Shadowbox closes. The single argument of this function will be the gallery element that was last displayed.  Defaults to null.
	onClose = null

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//oh; type=options[titleText,altText,imagecaption]; label= tt_content Caption Field: tt_content field to use as caption inside the Shadowbox.
	imgtext.captionField = titleText

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//oj; type=string; label= Players: Shadowbox supports a wide range of media formats. However, you may not need to display all of the supported formats on your page. For this purpose, several media "player" classes have been created that are able to display different types of content. Available "players" (See manual for more info.) : flv, html, iframe, img, qt, swf, wmp.
	players = flv, html, iframe, img, qt, swf, wmp

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//ok; type=string; label= Fallback Language: You can define the fallback language of the shadowbox script. The fallback is used if the variable config.language or a language file doesn't exists. Defaults to "en".
	fallbackLanguage = en

	# cat=pmkshadowbox//ol; type=options[auto,yes,no]; label=Scrollbar Behaviour of Iframes: You can changed the scrollbar behaviour of iframes with this setting. The "auto" option let the browser decide, but it's not the prefered solution in some cases. Just set the value to "no" to get finally rid of the scrollbars. The option defaults to "auto".
	iframeScrolling = auto

	# File options

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/file/f1; type=file[swf]; label= Videoplayer: The URL of the flash video player. Only needed when displaying Flash video content. Defaults to "EXT:pmkshadowbox/res/flvplayer.swf".
	flvPlayer = EXT:pmkshadowbox/res/flvplayer.swf

The "classic" skin is included with the default distribution, and it is hoped that more skins will become available as third-party developers have some time to explore the Shadowbox code. Defaults to "classic" skin.
	skinPath = EXT:pmkshadowbox/res/build/skin/classic

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/file/f3; type=file[js]; label= Javascript framework (optional): Enter path/name of javascript framework here, iIf you are using one of the following JavaScript frameworks: YUI, Ext, Prototype, jQuery, MooTools & Dojo Toolkit, as that library must be loaded before shadowbox.
	jsFramework =

	# Color options

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/color/c1; type=color; label= Overlay color: The color to use for the modal overlay (in hex). Defaults to "#000000".
	overlayColor = #000000

	# cat=pmkshadowbox/color/c2; type=color; label= Flash BG color: The default background color to use for Flash movies. Defaults to "#000000".
